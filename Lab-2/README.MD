# Overview
Jenkins Workshop

## Scope
These Lab-2 exercises will take you through the process of building a full stack (infrastructure and code) and orchestrating using Jenkins

## Instructions 
### Simple Exercise 
* Open the Jenkins URL (found in setup) 
* Navigate to the Jenkins "pipeline" job you had previously created. If you haven't created one yet do so now.


### Advanced Exercise 
* Open the Jenkins URL (found in setup) 
* Navigate to the Jenkins "pipeline" job you had previously created (in the Lab-1 Advanced Exercise). If you haven't created one yet do so now.
* In the script prepend a stage for creating the EC2 instance (you may either use the cloud formation under code-samples or create your own)
